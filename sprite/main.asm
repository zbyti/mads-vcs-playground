    Sprites are a tricky beast on the 2600.
    You only have two of them.
    They are 8 bits wide and 1 bit high.
    There's no way to position the X or Y coordinate directly.
    To position X, you have to wait until the TIA clock hits a
    given X position and then write to a register to lock it in.
    To position Y, you simply wait until the desired scanline and
    set the bits of your sprite to a non-zero value.
    Having fun yet? :)
